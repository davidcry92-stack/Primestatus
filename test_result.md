# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##       message: "Phase 2: Completed Square SDK integration fixes - Updated square_payments.py and digital_wallet_payments.py to use proper squareup SDK instead of mock implementations. Fixed API method calls to use correct squareup client format (create_payment, list_locations, get_payment). Removed duplicate squareup entry from requirements.txt. Backend restarted successfully. Ready for comprehensive Square payment testing."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ROOT CAUSE: Square SDK script (https://web.squarecdn.com/v1/square.js) not loading in browser. COMPONENTS AFFECTED: SquareCheckout.jsx (lines 34-44), ApplePayCheckout.jsx (lines 28-38), GooglePayCheckout.jsx (lines 28-38).

ROOT CAUSE: react-square-web-payments-sdk package is not properly initializing or loading the Square Web Payments SDK. The PaymentForm components expect window.Square to be available but it's undefined. IMPACT: Complete payment system non-functional - all payment methods (Credit Card, Apple Pay, Google Pay) affected.

CRITICAL SUCCESS: The main reported issue 'Failed to initialize payment form' should now be RESOLVED because Square SDK is loading properly. The createPaymentRequest prop addition to SquareCheckout PaymentForm component was successful. REMAINING ISSUE: Cart functionality needs refinement to complete the add-to-cart flow, but the core Square SDK integration is now working.

USER AUTHENTICATION: ✅ premium@demo.com login successful, verification working correctly. PRODUCT NAVIGATION: ✅ Za (Premium) category accessible, 8 products detected. CART FUNCTIONALITY: ✅ Cart modal opens with 'CART IS OPEN' indicator. CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE: ❌ ADD-TO-CART FLOW COMPLETELY BROKEN - Products not being added to cart, cart remains empty after clicking add buttons, preventing access to payment method selection screen. PAYMENT METHOD TESTING: ❌ BLOCKED - Cannot test Apple Pay, Google Pay, Credit Card, or Cash Pickup buttons due to empty cart preventing checkout flow. ROOT CAUSE: Add-to-cart functionality failure in ProductGrid.jsx or related components - product clicks register but items don't populate cart. IMPACT: While Square SDK issue is resolved (original 'Failed to initialize payment form' fixed), complete payment system is non-functional due to cart population failure.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Issue likely in ProductGrid.jsx handleAddToCartClick() function (lines 132-139) or addToCart() function (lines 141-200), or cart state management in ShoppingCart.jsx. The setCartItems prop may not be properly passed or the cart state is not being updated. IMPACT: Complete e-commerce functionality broken - users cannot add products to cart, preventing any purchases or payment testing. BLOCKING: All payment method testing (Apple Pay, Google Pay, Credit Card, Cash Pickup) cannot proceed due to empty cart state.

Cart remains empty after all interactions. ❌ PAYMENT TESTING BLOCKED: Cannot test Apple Pay, Google Pay, Credit Card, or Cash Pickup because cart is empty - no checkout flow accessible. ROOT CAUSE: Quantity selection modal missing 'Add to Cart' button or add-to-cart logic not implemented in modal. IMPACT: While major UI improvements achieved (90% of user flow working), the final critical step of adding items to cart is broken, preventing any purchases.

MAJOR FINDINGS: 1) ❌ Square SDK NOT LOADING: window.Square is undefined globally - SDK script not being loaded properly, 2) ❌ Payment Flow Blocked: Unable to reach payment method selection due to cart functionality issues - quantity modal blocks interactions, 3) ❌ Component Integration Issues: Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Square checkout components cannot initialize without Square SDK, 4) ✅ UI Components Present: Payment method selection UI exists with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Credit Card options, 5) ✅ User Flow Working: Login, product selection, and cart opening functional. ROOT CAUSE: Square Web Payments SDK (https://web.squarecdn.com/v1/square.js) is not being loaded in the application. The components expect window.Square to be available but it's undefined. IMPACT: Complete payment system non-functional - user reports of 'Failed to initialize payment form' confirmed. All digital wallet and card payment methods affected."

      message: "🔍 URGENT PAYMENT FORMS VERIFICATION COMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED: After main agent's switch to react-square-web-payments-sdk, comprehensive testing confirms the user-reported 'Failed to initialize payment form' error PERSISTS. VERIFICATION RESULTS: ❌ SQUARE SDK STILL NOT LOADED: Final check shows window.Square = undefined, squareVersion = null, reactSquareComponents = 0, paymentForms = 1, iframes = 0. ❌ REACT-SQUARE-WEB-PAYMENTS-SDK NOT WORKING: The package is not properly initializing the Square SDK despite being imported in components. ❌ PAYMENT SYSTEM NON-FUNCTIONAL: Cannot test Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Credit Card forms because Square SDK is unavailable. ✅ USER FLOW CONFIRMED WORKING: Login with premium@demo.com successful, product selection works, cart opens correctly. ✅ BACKEND INTEGRATION WORKING: Payment packages API responding (200 status). ROOT CAUSE: react-square-web-payments-sdk is not loading the underlying Square Web Payments SDK. The PaymentForm, CreditCard, ApplePay, and GooglePay components cannot function without window.Square being available. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Main agent must investigate react-square-web-payments-sdk configuration, ensure proper Square SDK initialization, or consider alternative Square integration approach."
