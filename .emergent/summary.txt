The trajectory details the development of the StatusXSmoakland application. It began with significant UI/UX refactoring, repositioning the Health-Aid (formerly Wictionary) section and updating product descriptions as per user feedback. New core features were added, including a comprehensive Delivery Coming Soon banner and an Admin Daily Deals system with video uploads and category-specific messages. A major undertaking was the complete replacement of the Stripe payment gateway with Square, involving significant backend and frontend changes. Recurring deployment synchronization issues plagued the live application. The current focus is on a critical bug in the preview app: the shopping cart's add-to-cart and checkout flow are broken, with the quantity selection modal not appearing and the cart icon not being clickable.

<product_requirements>
The StatusXSmoakland app is a members-only, pickup-only cannabis service prioritizing security and tiered access (Basic, Premium, Admin). Core features include a visual product grid, Health-Aid cannabis dictionary (formerly Wictionary), and a shopping cart with payment processing. Recent requirements focused on rebranding (affordable, Health-Aid), removing Daily Deals, and specific UI placements (Health-Aid card/button after Wellness, specific header texts like NYC PICKUP LOCATION Delivery Coming Soon!). New features include an Admin Daily Deals system with video uploads, category-based messaging (24hr expiry), and Delivery Coming Soon banner with email signup. Admin panels for Health-Aid terms and Strains with images were also requested.

<pending_tasks>
- Debug and fix the add-to-cart functionality in the preview application:
    - Ensure the quantity selection modal appears when a product is selected.
    - Make the cart icon on the header clickable to open the shopping cart modal.
- Address the persistent deployment synchronization issues between the preview and the deployed live application.

The AI engineer is currently debugging a critical issue in the preview application's shopping cart. The user reported that after selecting a quantity for a product, nothing happens, and items cannot be added to the cart, and even if added, the cart icon is not clickable.

The previous attempts to fix this involved:
1.  Connecting  to the main cart state (, ) managed in  via . This initially led to items being added, but the quantity modal wasn't appearing, and the cart icon wasn't clickable.
2.  Further investigation revealed that the  function in  was checking for  availability, and if not present, would alert Cart functionality is currently unavailable.
3.  Debugging was added to  and  to verify prop passing.
4.  It was then discovered that  (which should trigger the quantity modal) was not working correctly, possibly due to a  component issue or unwanted navigation. The native HTML button was temporarily used with  and  which made items add to cart, but still no quantity modal and no clickable cart icon.

The immediate problem is that the cart icon in the  is not opening the  modal when clicked, and the quantity selection modal is not appearing. The AI is currently examining the  component to understand why its  function is not being triggered by the cart icon.
