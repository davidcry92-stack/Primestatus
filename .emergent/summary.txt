The AI engineer's trajectory involved significant work on the StatusXSmoakland app. Initial efforts focused on updating the product catalog () with out-of-stock items and retail images, and populating the Wictionary (, ) with comprehensive strain definitions. This required extensive file edits, use of a vision expert, and backend database seeding fixes due to category mismatches and empty production databases.

A major challenge arose with authentication and deployment. The AI iteratively addressed Preview Unavailable errors, screenshot protection issues, and a series of persistent login failures. This involved removing temporary admin bypasses, fixing incorrect backend URLs in the frontend, correcting database names, and rectifying issues caused by inadvertently clearing legitimate user tokens. Despite numerous attempts and troubleshooting, deployed logins remained problematic, ultimately being identified as a platform-level routing/infrastructure issue.

The work concluded with the user instructing to pause deployment troubleshooting and proceed with new feature development. The AI commenced implementing Stripe payment integration, establishing backend models and routes, and initiating a frontend shopping cart component.

<product_requirements>
The StatusXSmoakland app is a members-only cannabis pickup service emphasizing efficient inventory, auto-generated daily deals, and tiered member profiles (Basic/Premium with Wictionary access). It requires stringent security (screenshot blocking, re-entry codes, ID verification), pickup-only transactions with admin verification, and cash payment. A robust admin system is needed for member management, transaction history, and pickup/payment recording. Key user features include a visual clickable product selection for categories (Lows, Deps, Za, pre-rolls, edibles, vapes, concentrates, suppositories) and a 1-5 star product rating system.

Recent updates included removing delivery, UI refinements, updating product lists with in-stock/out-of-stock separation, tier-based quantity selection, integrating actual product images, and comprehensive Wictionary definitions. The user explicitly requested an all-access admin login (no verification, full app demo), re-entry codes only on app closure, and for admins to access all admin/premium features. Strict authentication was consistently requested, ensuring no content is visible to unauthenticated or unverified users. The current task involves implementing Stripe payment integration and shopping cart functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was instructed to continue building features in the StatusXSmoakland app while the persistent deployment issues are addressed externally. The current focus is on **Phase 1: Payment Integration & Shopping Cart**.

The following actions have been taken for payment integration:
1.  **Stripe Python library installation**: The  package was installed in the backend.
2.  **Stripe API key configuration**:  has been added to the  file.
3.  **Payment model creation**: A new file, , was created to define Pydantic models for payment-related data.
4.  **Payment route creation**: A new file, , was created to handle API endpoints related to payments.
5.  **Payment router integration**: The new  has been included in the main FastAPI application in .
6.  **Shopping cart component creation**: A new frontend component, , was created.

The application's local environment currently features a rich product catalog with dynamic images, a comprehensive Wictionary with tiered access, and a working authentication system for various user roles. However, the deployment environment still suffers from infrastructure-related authentication failures.
