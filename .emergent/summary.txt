The AI engineer focused heavily on enhancing the StatusXSmoakland application's product catalog and Wictionary. Initial tasks involved completing out-of-stock product additions for Deps and Za in , which was mostly done on the frontend but revealed database seeding inconsistencies. A major effort was directed towards a user request to populate inventory with actual retail product images across all categories (Vapes, Pre-rolls, Blendz, Concentrates, Edibles, Suppositories), meticulously updating  and verifying changes with screenshots. Concurrently, the AI engineer addressed a Wictionary completion request, extracting definitions from provided documents and integrating them into  to power . The process involved multiple iterations of image and Wictionary updates based on user feedback. The trajectory concluded with a frontend JavaScript error occurring after the latest Wictionary update, indicating a parsing or rendering issue in  or its data source.

The goal is to build StatusXSmoakland, a members-only cannabis pickup app, emphasizing efficient inventory management, auto-generated daily deals, and personalized member profiles across basic and premium tiers (Wictionary access). It requires stringent security (screenshot blocking, re-entry codes, ID verification), pickup-only transactions with admin verification, and cash payment. A robust admin system is needed for member management, transaction history, and pickup/payment recording. Key features include a comprehensive Wictionary for terms and strains, a visual clickable product selection interface for categories (Lows, Deps, Za, pre-rolls, edibles, vapes, concentrates, suppositories) with provided graphics, and a 1-5 star product rating system with a 500-character experience field. Recent updates involved removing delivery, refining UI, updating specific product lists with in-stock/out-of-stock separation, adding tier-based quantity selection, and integrating actual product images and comprehensive Wictionary definitions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on two primary areas: enhancing the product inventory with actual retail images and completing the Wictionary with comprehensive strain definitions. The inventory was successfully updated across multiple categories (Vapes, Pre-rolls, Blendz, Concentrates, Edibles, Suppositories) in , using both vision expert agent and user-provided images. This involved meticulous matching of images to products and verification via frontend screenshots, which confirmed all products displayed correct, authentic imagery. Concurrently, the AI engineer integrated extensive strain definitions from user-uploaded documents into  to populate the . The Wictionary update was verified via screenshots showing comprehensive terms and search functionality. The most recent action was an attempt to verify the updated Wictionary, which resulted in a frontend JavaScript error, specifically reading properties of undefined, indicating an issue within  or the newly structured  data.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to diagnose and fix the JavaScript errors in the Wictionary component.
