<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory for StatusXSmoakland involved an extensive, iterative development process. Initially, core functionality and security were addressed, followed by significant feature additions and bug fixes based on user feedback. Key accomplishments include implementing a member profile system with a token rewards program, integrating Apple Pay and Google Pay (using Square's sandbox), and refining the checkout flow. A major focus was on enhancing security through granular authentication controls, idle timeouts, and resolving persistent bypasses. UI cleanup involved removing auto-generated deals and clarifying membership pricing displays. The conversation also highlighted recurring challenges with deployment-specific issues and UI elements not reflecting local changes. The work concluded while troubleshooting a critical issue where the application preview was completely inaccessible, suspected to be due to a missing backend API for daily deals.

<product_requirements>
The StatusXSmoakland application is a members-only cannabis service focused on pickup orders, with Basic, Premium, and Admin access tiers.
Key requirements and features implemented/addressed so far:
1.  **Member Profiles**: Create profiles for basic/premium users linked to email, ID scan data, and ID photo. Include order history, suggestions, and a token system (12 purchases = 10 tokens = 0 in-app cash value). Accessible via a hamburger dropdown.
2.  **Payment & Checkout**: Functional checkout with Credit/Debit (Square), Cash Pickup, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Cart modal closes immediately on Proceed to Checkout. Payments should be functional in deployed environments.
3.  **Authentication & Security**: Strict multi-step verification (Law Enforcement, re-entry code) must be enforced, preventing bypasses. Login/signup modals auto-reset after 2 minutes inactivity. Re-entry code required after 60 seconds of app inactivity. Admin users should navigate directly to the dashboard post-login. Daily deals should be visible to logged-in users without additional verification.
4.  **Admin Features**: Admin dashboard with Cash Pickup Lookup, Daily Square Reports, and Pre-paid Lookup Verification tabs. Daily deals should be managed and generated by admins, not auto-generated.
5.  **UI/UX**: Consistent dark theme. Remove auto-generated daily deals and the Join StatusXSmoakland green button from the main screen. Membership pricing displays should be contextual (Premium users see no pricing, Basic users see only Premium upgrade options). Restore specific HeroSection content (NYC PICKUP LOCATION â€¢ DELIVERY COMING SOON and badges) without pricing cards, and replace app store buttons with admin-generated daily deals.

<pending_tasks>
-   Address the missing backend API endpoint  for fetching admin-generated daily deals.
-   Ensure Square SDK (Python) is correctly installed and integrated to replace the current mock payment implementation.
-   Thoroughly test the deployed application after all fixes to confirm UI elements (daily deals, buttons, pricing logic) and payment flows work as expected.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was troubleshooting a critical issue where the application preview was completely inaccessible (I can not see the preview at all - Chat 804). The frontend logs indicated successful compilation, leading the AI to suspect a JavaScript error within the  component due to a failing API call to .

To prevent the app from crashing and to make the preview visible, the AI engineer applied a temporary fix in  (Chat 808-810). This fix provides a fallback mechanism, presumably to display No active deals or similar, if the backend endpoint is unreachable or returns an error. The AI is in the process of restarting the frontend (,  - Chat 811).

The user's most recent interaction was reporting the preview being invisible, which the AI is actively trying to resolve, with the primary hypothesis being an issue with the daily deals API endpoint.

<optional_next_step>
Restart the frontend and test if the application preview is now visible to the user.
